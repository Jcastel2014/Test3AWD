we need to create an alias for the 'user' key that we will add to
the context object. The context object takes a key:value pair. However, the

so we don't know if our 'user' key will be overwritten so we need to create
an alias to avoid that from happening

Great so we will pass in the 'user' key and cast it to the contextKey
type just like how you would cast a double to an int - double(45) -> 45.0
Now when we want to add some info about the user, the entry will be:
userContextKey: info.
Result: It is highly unlikely that our API will interact with some other
third-party service that also needs access to the request context and it
also uses the key 'userContextKey' as the name of its key.
